# contentDruid
A collection of Python scripts for various content object jobs. These are very powerful scripts, so please read the spec and use them with respect and ease. A _sloth_ is is a passive script, finding things for you. A _load_ requires some sort of input file. 
p.s. I like to call [Python](https://www.python.org/) scripts, "Python pythons." Why? Because it is fun :)  
Eveything is written in __Python 3.6.5__ with 3.X in mind

## filesSlothRestore.py
A Python python to find deleted file objects and restore them  
_REQUIRES_  
[requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)  

_USAGE_  
This Python python takes two agruments: `accessToken` & `slothStart`  
`accessToken` - An access_token for the portal you want to filesSlothRestore  
`slothStart` - A millisecond unix timestamp used in the `deleted_at__gt` request parameter to dictate the start time of file deletion timestamps to GET  

```
$ python3 filesSlothRestore.py 1234-5678-9123-4567 1529816400000  
```
Runs `filesSlothRestore.py` finding files deleted after 1529816400000 (June 24th, 2018 0:00:00) for portal with access token `1234-5678-9123-4567`  

## filesDeleteLoad.py
DELETES file objects by id  
_REQUIRES_  
[requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)  

_USAGE_  
This Python python takes one agrument: `accessToken`    
`accessToken` - An access_token for the portal you want to filesDeleteLoad  

It also requires a Python list of file object ids to delete, set in the `filesToDelete` variable, like: `filesToDelete = [1234, 5678, 3658, 8573]`  

```
$ python3 filesDeleteLoad.py 1234-5678-9123-4567
```
Runs `filesDeleteLoad.py` on portal with access token `1234-5678-9123-4567`, DELETING every file object id in the `filesToDelete` variable

## urlMappingLoad.py
A Python python to bulk edit and create URL mapping objects. Regex `(!DEL!).*?[\d]+` is a good way to remove the `!DEL!<some number>` from restored mappings    
_REQUIRES_  
[requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)  

_USAGE_  
This Python python takes one agrument: `accessToken`    
`accessToken` - An access_token for the portal you want to urlMappingLoad  
This Python python also requires a JSON file to import. This file should be called `mappingsToLoad.json` and should live in the "import" folder - path `import/mappingsToLoad.json`.  This file should have a JSON object with the updated JSON of the mappings you wish to update, and that of new mappings to create, like:
```
[
    {  
        "id":5265745360,
        "destination":"https://www.destination.com",
        "redirectStyle":301
    },
    {  
        "id":4967273182,
        "isMatchFullUrl": true,
        "isProtocolAgnostic": false
    },
    {  
        "routePrefix":"https://www.routeprefix.com/prefix",
        "destination":"https://www.destination.com/destination",
        "isOnlyAfterNotFound":true,
        "redirectStyle":301,
        "precedence":123,
        "isPattern": false,
        "isMatchQueryString": true
    }
]
```
Only the included JSON keys will be updated for a given mapping id included in `mappingsToLoad.json` (first 2 examples). Mapping objects in `mappingsToLoad.json` without an `id` key will be created as new mappings (3rd example). 

```
$ python3 urlMappingLoad.py 1234-5678-9123-4567  
```
Runs `urlMappingLoad.py` on portal with access token `1234-5678-9123-4567`, updating each mapping id included in `mappingsToLoad.json` with the included keys in in the first two individual mapping JSON objects, and creating a new mapping with included keys for the third
